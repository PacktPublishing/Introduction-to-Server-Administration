## About the Video Course
Are you a developer who wants to be able to deploy and manage your own servers? Perhaps you want to start working in server-side development and need to understand the backend environment. Maybe you're interested in starting a career in server administration and want to understand the fundamentals? The fact is, if you're a web developer or web technologist, you need to understand server administration. After you complete this course you will be able to independently provision your own web servers, and deploy saleable web applications that can be shared globally. You'll learn the tools of the trade used by server administrators, and how to properly secure your web servers. This is a course about doing - not simply watching an instructor. In the very first chapter, you'll hit the ground running as you create and configure your first server. During the course, you'll master command interface tools like NANO and VIM. You'll examine package managers and understand the LAMP stack. This course also prepares you to work with GIT code repositories and the popular MySQL database. You'll also learn the important server administration skills of working with security and logs. When you enroll in this class you'll join a community of learners led by LearnToProgram's Henry Quinn. If you'd like to add server administration to your list of skills, we'll look forward to seeing you in class.
